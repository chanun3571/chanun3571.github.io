My main contribution to this paper, apart from being the main author, includes:
 - Design and fabrication of main hardware demonstrated in the paper, this includes the syringe pump extruder, the syringe heater, and the cold bed.
 - Generation of the GCODE commands and minor modification of the printer's firmware for usage in the experiments.
