I have been invited to provide a special lecture for undergraduate students at the International School of Engineering (ISE), Chulalongkorn University. In this session, I explain the main types of industrial sensors, their working principles, limitations, and implementations. I also highlighted my practical experiences with the sensor selection process for my research and engineering projects.
