I have been invited to supervise a workshop session for undergraduate students in the Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Engineering Program at, the International School of Engineering (ISE), Chulalongkorn University.

I demonstrated a camera-equipped conveyor belt system, with a Raspberry Pi microcomputer to process the footage. The system runs on Python code, which detects and displays the position of the object on the belt using simple thresholding techniques and pattern recognition. I explained the working principle of this system from the IO communication of the controller to the details of image processing. 

After that, the students get the chance to implement and upgrade my code to detect objects with more advanced shapes and colors through their laptop webcam.
