excerpt: "On August 26, 2023, I had the privilege of participating in Falling Walls Lab Thailand 2023â€”a world-class research pitch competition. I'm excited to share the presentation of my research titled 'Breaking the Wall of Human-Swarm Interaction'. In real-world scenarios, deploying a swarm of drones using a one-human-one-drone setup, although functional, encounters challenges of scalability and efficiency for coordinated tasks. This challenge led me to innovate and overcome these barriers in human-swarm interaction by integrating virtual reality technology with a one-human-multiple-drone setup. This approach facilitates synchronized drone formations, all guided by a single human operator. The underlying algorithms ensure scalability and safety during coordinated tasks. Impressively, the entire physical drone swarm can be traced back to a single virtual drone, intuitively controlled through the human operator's hand movements from a third-person perspective. This system simplifies human-swarm interaction, thereby enhancing control and efficiency. The setup underwent rigorous testing with volunteers, yielding results that underscore the augmented control capabilities enabled by virtual reality when operating drone swarms. Importantly, the system maintains a consistent human workload even with an increasing number of drone agents. I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to the Falling Walls Foundation for fostering an environment that nurtures cutting-edge research and facilitates enriching discussions among peers, experts from academia and business, and the wider audience. The feedback received and connections made during this journey are truly invaluable.<br/> <br/> <img src='/images/talks_images/falling1.jpg' width='300' height='450'> <img src='/images/talks_images/falling2.jpg' width='300' height='450'> <img src='/images/talks_images/falling3.jpg' width='300' height='450'> "
