excerpt: "On August 26, 2023, I had the privilege of participating in Falling Walls Lab Thailand 2023â€”a world-class research pitch competition. I'm excited to share the presentation of my research titled 'Breaking the Wall of Human-Swarm Interaction'. In real-world scenarios, deploying a swarm of drones using a one-human-one-drone setup, although functional, encounters challenges of scalability and efficiency for coordinated tasks. This challenge led me to innovate and overcome these barriers in human-swarm interaction by integrating virtual reality technology with a one-human-multiple-drone setup. <br/> <br/> <img src='/images/talks_images/falling1.jpg' width='310' height='auto'> <img src='/images/talks_images/falling2.jpg' width='310' height='auto'> <img src='/images/talks_images/falling3.jpg' width='310' height='auto'> "
