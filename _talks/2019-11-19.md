I presented my publication on the topic of “Temperature Control for Hydrogel Bio-Printing” at the _9th IEEE International Conference on Cybernetics and Intelligent Systems (CIS) and IEEE Conference on Robotics, Automation and Mechatronics (RAM)_

I proposed a precise temperature control system for the syringe extruder and the print bed in this work. The temperature is a key parameter for the 3D bioprinting of hydrogels. The gel must be kept at a warm temperature to maintain its gel state, if not warm enough the gel will solidify and clog the print nozzle, but the overheating could damage the cells encapsulated inside. In contrast, the print bed temperature must be maintained at a low temperature to promote solidification, but not beyond the freezing point of the gel.
