•Participated in a winter conference, alongside students from top universities across Asia, hosted by Harvard students.
•Hosted a spring conference, being a cultural ambassador to promote Thailand to Harvard students and delegates from other countries.
•Developed a much better understanding of the culturally complex international communities and foster cooperative relationships with young leaders from the United States and Asian countries.

I presented my publication on the topic of “Temperature Control for Hydrogel Bio-Printing” at the _9th IEEE International Conference on Cybernetics and Intelligent Systems (CIS) and IEEE Conference on Robotics, Automation and Mechatronics (RAM)_

I proposed a precise temperature control system for the syringe extruder and the print bed in this work. The temperature is a key parameter for the 3D bioprinting of hydrogels. The gel must be kept at a warm temperature to maintain its gel state, if not warm enough the gel will solidify and clog the print nozzle, but the overheating could damage the cells encapsulated inside. In contrast, the print bed temperature must be maintained at a low temperature to promote solidification, but not beyond the freezing point of the gel.
