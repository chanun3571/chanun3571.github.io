I am actively seeking roles in the field of swarm robotics and am open to relocating for either full-time or contract positions. I recently completed my master's degree in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) with a specialization in swarm robotics. I am particularly enthusiastic about the potential to enhance efficiency through human-swarm interaction, an area that I believe holds significant promise. I am eager to contribute to the development of systems that facilitate safe and productive interactions between humans and robotic swarms. Beyond academia, I have actively participated in social and volunteer initiatives in collaboration with both local and international universities. These experiences have enriched my perspective and reinforced my appreciation for diverse cultures and the value of respectful interactions with individuals from around the world.

I am a highly motivated researcher driven by my deep passion and profound experience in 3D printing technology of soft matter, especially biomaterial and viscoelastic material. I am extremely determined to pursue a Ph.D. degree and become an impactful researcher in this field.

The [Research page](/research) highlights my 4 years of research experience in 3D bioprinting and soft matter printing technology along with other research experience throughout my undergraduate degree at Chulalongkorn University and my Master's degree at Imperial College London. My remarkable research achievements are shown on this [Publications page](/publications).

These [projects](/projects) illustrate my proficiency in mechanical design and rapid prototyping with considerable experience in many types of 3D printing technology. Alongside other relevant skills such as cell culture, electrical circuit design, and programming, I am a fast learner who can work in a highly multidisciplinary research environment with exceptional adaptability.

I am immensely passionate about science and engineering. I consider myself a maker who loves to build engineering gadgets and understand how things work, with a home workshop where I've developed a remote 3D printing system with a built-in fume control hood.

Additionally, I co-founded Digitech Fabrication, a Thailand-based 3D printing startup supporting engineering research and education. More about the company can be found on this website. <br/>
