Aside from research experience, I have several chances to use my research knowledge with real industry. I have worked with real industrial projects through university-industry collaborative projects, internship, and exchange programs. Check the [Work Experiences page](/experiences) for more details.

Aside from research experience, I have participated in several extra-curricular academic and social activities. For example, a world-class research pitching competition, the Falling Wall Lab Thailand, Harvard College in Asia Program (HCAP), robotic design contest (RDC). More details of each activity can be found on the [Activities page](/activities)

The exchange research in Tokyo Institute of Technology was supported by Japan Student Services Organization scholarship. Aside from research, I have an opportunity to visit several companies and research institutes. I took a fundamental Japanese language and cultural classes.  I presented in MISW2022. For example, JFE Steel Corporation, JR East Japan R&D Center, TDK Corporation Technical Center, and RIKEN Headquarters.
