I am a highly motivated engineer and researcher driven by my deep passion and profound experience in robotics, especially with multiple robot systems. My research span around several perspective consisting with communication protocol, robotics design, digital twin. In order to conduct research, software development and algorithm development. I have extensive experience working with drones, mobile robots, and manipulators (Universal Robot). The Publication page highlights my 4 years of research experience in robotics. Each research comes with a download link toward the end of the published article.
Aside from research experience, I have several chances to use my research knowledge with real industry. I have worked with real industrial projects through university-industry collaborative projects, internship, and exchange programs. For example, 
Aside from research experience, I have participated in several extra-curricular academic and social activities. For example, a world-class research pitching competition, the Falling Wall Lab Thailand, Harvard College in Asia Program (HCAP), robotic design contest (RDC). More details of each activity can be found on the Activities page.

The exchange research in Tokyo Institute of Technology was supported by Japan Student Services Organization scholarship. Aside from research, I have an opportunity to visit several companies and research institutes. I took a fundamental Japanese language and cultural classes.  I presented in MISW2022. For example, JFE Steel Corporation, JR East Japan R&D Center, TDK Corporation Technical Center, and RIKEN Headquarters.

I am a highly motivated researcher driven by my deep passion and profound experience in robotics, especially biomaterial and viscoelastic material. 

The [Work Experiences page](/experiences) highlights my 4 years of research experience in 3D bioprinting and soft matter printing technology along with other research experience throughout my undergraduate degree at Chulalongkorn University and my Master's degree at Imperial College London. My remarkable research achievements are shown on this [Publications page](/publications).

These [Activities page](/activities) illustrate my proficiency in mechanical design and rapid prototyping with considerable experience in many types of 3D printing technology. Alongside other relevant skills such as cell culture, electrical circuit design, and programming, I am a fast learner who can work in a highly multidisciplinary research environment with exceptional adaptability.

I am immensely passionate about science and engineering. I consider myself a maker who loves to build engineering gadgets and understand how things work, with a home workshop where I've developed a remote 3D printing system with a built-in fume control hood.
