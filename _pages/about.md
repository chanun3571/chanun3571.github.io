I am a highly motivated engineer and researcher, fueled by a profound passion for robotics and extensive experience in the field. My research endeavors span a wide range of areas, including the design of robotic network architectures, human-robot interaction, 3D design of robot hardware, robot software development, and simulation of digital twins. You can explore my research journey on the [Publications page](/publications), where each study is accompanied by a downloadable link to the published article.

In addition to my research background, I have had valuable opportunities to apply my knowledge in practical industry settings. These experiences have arisen from collaborative projects between my university and various industries, internships, and research exchange programs. For a detailed account of my work experience, please refer to the [Work Experience page](/experience).

Over the course of my four-year journey in robotics, which includes both research and hands-on industry projects, I have gained extensive expertise in working with various types of robots. These include drones, mobile robots, manipulators, and mobile manipulator robots. Some examples of the robots I have worked with are provided below. <br/> <img src='/images/about_images/manipulator5.gif' width='158' height='158'> <img src='/images/about_images/mobilemani2.jpg' width='150' height='150'> <img src='/images/about_images/drone1.gif' width='440' height='440'>

Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I have actively engaged in extracurricular activities that have enriched my overall development. These activities encompass a wide spectrum, such as participation in prestigious research pitching competitions like Falling Wall Lab Thailand, cultural exchange programs like the Harvard College in Asia Program (HCAP), and involvement in robotic competitions like the Robotic Design Contest (RDC). Moreover, I had the privilege of serving as an exchange researcher at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, supported by a scholarship from the Japan Student Services Organization. During my stay, I have visited and gained insights from various esteemed companies and research institutes, including JFE Steel Corporation, JR East Japan R&D Center, TDK Corporation.
